Hi! I’m Max Kurzner, a PhD student in Astrophysics at the University of Victoria in Victoria, BC, Canada.

My interests broadly span  galaxy properties from initial mass functions of stellar populations to environmental effects on galaxy formation and evolution

I am currently working with my advisor Dr. Pat Côté on the connections Galaxy Morphology and the observable physical quantites of galaxies by studying Virgo Cluster galaxies
identified through the Next Generation Virgo Survey (NGVS)
